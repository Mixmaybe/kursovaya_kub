A big but simple project which introduce themself a 3D-cube with ability to rotate by the 3 axes with changeable speed of rotation

if you want to rotate the cube yourself, then use the keyboard arrows, where:

up arrow - OX rotation in +;
down arrow - OX rotation in -;
right arrow - OY rotation in +;
left arrow - OY rotation in -;
W key - OZ rotation in +;
S key - OZ rotation in -;

increase the rotation speed - key 2 on Numpad;
decrease the rotation speed - key 1 on Numpad;


if you want the cube to rotate on its own, then:

key R - increase the rotation speed by OX (in +);
key F - decrease the rotation speed by OX;
key T - increase the speed of rotation by OY (in +);
key G - decrease the speed of rotation by OY;
key Y - increase the speed of rotation by OZ (in +);
key H - decrease the speed of rotation by OZ;
